# Network_compressibility
Data and code for "Compressibility of complex networks" by Christopher W. Lynn and Danielle S. Bassett

Data for undirected networks are in files labelled "graphs_[graph family]_samples_undirected.mat".

Data for directed networks are in files labelled "graphs_[graph family]_samples_directed.mat".

The main scripts used to analyze the networks are "script_rate_distortion_real_samples.m" and "script_rate_distortion_real_samples_directed.m".

The function used to compute the rate-distortion curve of a network is "rate_distortion_upper.m".
